    <h3 class="mt-3">Changes to Privacy Policy</h3>
    <p class="mt-2">We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time without notice to you by among other ways, posting the revised Privacy Policy in the "Privacy Policy" section of the Site. The revised Privacy Policy is effective immediately when posted. It is your responsibility to review the Site and the Privacy Policy periodically to learn of any modifications. Your continued use of the Site, or any product or service offered through the Site, after the posting of any modifications will constitute your acknowledgment and acceptance of the terms of the modified Privacy Policy.</p>
    <h3 class="mt-3">Types of Information Collected and Uses of Collected Information</h3>
    <p>We collect two types of information about our Site Users: Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information.</p>

    <p>Personally Identifiable Information. Personally Identifiable Information is information that identifies a specific End User. When you engage in certain activities on or off the Website, such as creating an account, signing in to your account, ordering a product or service from us or our partners, adding items to your shopping cart, submitting content and/or posting User Content, entering a contest or sweepstakes sponsored by us or our partners, filling out a survey, posting a review, sending us or our partners feedback, requesting information about our services, submitting an affiliate agreement, applying for a job or to be a consultant or supplier, posting a video or signing up for special offers from third parties through the Website (collectively, "Identification Activities"), we may ask you to provide certain information about yourself. It is optional for you to engage in an Identification Activity. If you elect to engage in an Identification Activity, however, we may ask you to provide us with certain personal information about yourself, such as your first and last name, mailing address (including zip code), email address, telephone number, date of birth and Restaurant.com account information. When you order products or services, we may also ask you to provide us with your credit card number, expiration date and authentication codes or related information. We may also know your location if you access the Site. Depending on the activity, some of the information we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some is identified as voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory information for a particular activity that requires it, you will not be permitted to engage in that activity.</p>

    <p>We may collect, use and store Personally Identifiable Information, including credit card information, to provide products and services to you, make the log-in and checkout process easier, administer our Rewards Program, sweepstakes and contests, help you track your past purchases and orders, enhance the operation of the Site, improve our marketing and promotional efforts to your tastes and location, customize future shopping interests, analyze Site use, improve our product and service offerings, and to tailor your experience with third parties as provided in Item 3 of this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <p>If you provide User Content, such as an email to our customer service or response to a restaurant survey, we may use your comments and feedback to tell others about our services, and may post your comment in our marketing materials or on our Website. In connection with such User Content and our Rewards Program, we may also display partial information such as first name, initial of last name, city and state. Such partial information is not considered Personally Identifiable Information.</p>

    <p>In addition, if you use our Site to send information or a product to another person, we may store your personal information, and the personal information of any recipient. We may use that other person’s contact information to allow him or her to view and accept your gift or to allow the recipient to access the information you requested we send. As another example, if you put items in your shopping cart, we may save the items you have selected to make your checkout process easier in the future, or to remind you about the items you may have forgotten. We may also use Personally Identifiable Information to troubleshoot, resolve disputes, accomplish administrative tasks, contact you, enforce our agreements with you, including our Site Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy, comply with applicable law, and cooperate with law enforcement activities.</p>

    <p>Non-Personally Identifiable Information. Non-Personally Identifiable Information is information that does not identify a specific End User. This type of information may include things like the Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") of the website you visited before coming to our Website, the URL of the website you visit after leaving our Website, the type of browser you are using and your Internet Protocol ("IP") address. We, and/or our authorized Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers, may automatically collect this information when you visit our Website through the use of electronic tools like Cookies and Web beacons or Pixel tags, as described in Items 4 and 8 of this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <p>We use Non-Personally Identifiable Information to troubleshoot, administer the Website, analyze trends, gather demographic information, comply with applicable law, and cooperate with law enforcement activities. We may also share this information with our authorized Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers to measure the overall effectiveness of our online advertising, content, and programming.</p>

    <h3 class="mt-3">Security of Information</h3>
    <p>We take security seriously and take numerous precautions to protect the security of Personally Identifiable Information. You can access your Personally Identifiable Information on our Website through a password and unique User ID selected by you, or, for restaurant partners, by us. This password is encrypted. We recommend that you do not share your password with anyone. In addition, your Personally Identifiable Information resides on a secure server that only selected personnel and contractors have access to. We encrypt certain sensitive information using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to ensure that your Personally Identifiable Information is safe as it is transmitted to us.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we employ commercially reasonable security measures to protect data and seek to partner with companies which do the same, we cannot guarantee the security of any information transmitted to or from the Website, and are not responsible for the actions of any third parties that may receive any such information.</p>

    <h3 class="mt-3">Data Tracking</h3>
    <p>Cookies. To facilitate and customize your experience with the Website, we store cookies on your computer. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a User’s computer for record-keeping purposes which contains information about that User. We use cookies and other browser analytics tools to save you time while using the Website, remind us who you are, administer our Rewards Program and track and target User interests in order to provide a customized experience. Cookies and web analytics tools also allow us to collect information about your experience, like which pages you visited, what links you clicked on, and, when combined with information you provide to us, we may be able to tell what kind of items you may be interested in to make your experience more enjoyable. Use of this information helps us to create a more user-friendly experience for all visitors. In addition, we may use Third Party Advertising Companies to display advertisements on our Website. As part of their service, they may place separate cookies on your computer. We have no access to or control over these cookies. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by our Website only and does not cover the use of cookies by any Advertiser. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you may be able to modify your browser settings to decline cookies. Please note that if you decline or delete these cookies, some parts of the Website may not work properly.</p>

    <p>Other Tracking Devices. We may use other industry standard technologies like pixel tags, web beacons and other tools to track your use of our Website pages and promotions, or we may allow our Third Party Service Providers to use these devices on our behalf. These tools are software code that allows us to determine what pages you visit, whether you have performed a specific action, etc. When you access these pages or open or click an email, these tools generate a notice of that action. These tools allow us to measure and improve our understanding of visitor traffic and behavior on our Website, as well as give us a way to measure our promotions and performance. We may also utilize pixel tags, web beacons and other tools provided by our Affiliates and/or Marketing Partners for the same purposes.</p>
